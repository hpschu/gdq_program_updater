# Server-end updater for the gdq_program_updater
The gdq_program_updater is a project for arduino wifi (MKR1000)
where the server handles the heavy lifting, providing a simple web
page (by this script) for the arduino to parse and display to 
an LCD.
Store the data produced by this script to a file (index.html)
to your web server and point the arduino to that page to parse the
information and display it on the LCD.
Simple.
